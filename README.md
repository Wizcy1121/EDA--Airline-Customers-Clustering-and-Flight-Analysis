# EDA--Airline-Customers-Clustering-and-Flight-Analysis

## Business goal
Help an airline company find meaningful customer segments to better target their current customers while marketing and to increase their loyalty membership program.

## Overall Process
1. First, implemented clustering to seperate customers into meaningful groups based on similar flying traits.

* **Cluster 1: Frequent 1st-Class Flyers** There are 27.8% of the customers in this cluster who are repeat flyers, and 87.7% of flights taken in the clusters are first-class flights. On average, this cluster spent $622 on a flight, which is $200 more than any other cluster. This is the smallest 23 cluster, with 2.4% of all customers. Of the 38% of customers in the cluster who are Ufly members, 97.3% are standard members.

* **Cluster 2: One Time Low Spenders** This cluster has only 8% repeat flyers, which is 5% less than any other cluster. This cluster is distinct by how, on average, customers spend $107 per flight, which is over $200 less than any other cluster.

* **Cluster 3: SCA Bookers** The cluster has over 99% of the bookings come from the SCA Website or SY Vacation. This is the largest cluster with 617,000 customers, which is 40% of all SCA customers. Repeat flyers in this cluster is 16%, which is the median of all the clusters.

* **Cluster 4: Outside Bookers** This cluster almost exclusively books from outside channels, any website other than SCA Website or SY Vacation. There is a cluster size of 415,000 customers, with 27% of all customers, and the most popular time to fly is in Quarter 3. It also has the second lowest membership proportion of 11% of customers being members.

* **Cluster 5: Upgraders** The last cluster is distinctly defined by the percentage of seat upgrades. This cluster has 70% of all the upgraded flights among all the clusters, which is 65% more upgrades than any other cluster. They spend an average of $316 per flight, and 19.6% of customers are repeat flyers. They make up 70% of all upgrades yet only purchase 3.5% of first-class flight purchases.

2. Next, I looked at how long it took to join the airline's membership program (Ufly).

3. Finally, combining the clustering solution with the Ufly membership analysis, I was able to recommend targeting specific clusters to improve Ufly membership and increase website bookings
